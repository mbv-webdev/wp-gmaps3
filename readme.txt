Google Maps Shortcode Integration

== Description ==

This Plugin uses [GMAP3 Plugin for jQuery](http://gmap3.net)

It's generating HTML/Javascript/jQuery to load a small Google Maps container. 

Usage Example: [gmaps center="{latitude},{longitude}" zoom={zoom} marker="{lat},{long}" destination="123 Sample Way, Anytown"]
	
You can split up the route form from your google maps with [groute]

[groute] requires the [gmaps] code being called beforehand!

= The following arguments are possible: =
* center: view of the map in "lat,long"
* zoom: zoom step
* marker: you can set an alternative marker, that is not centered
* height: height of the maps div
* width: width of the maps div
* destination: destination address (street and city), required for route planner
* with-route: add a route planner

for more details about the arguments, see the [documentation of jQuery gmap3](http://gmap3.net/en/catalog/)
